                     <h3>Why did you become a nurse?</h3>
                        <p>I always wanted to be in the medical/health field growing up. I thought about becoming 
                        a medical doctor when I was in college. I enjoyed the fact that nurses spend much more 
                        quality time with the patients. Therefore, I went for nursing.
                        </p>
                     <h3>
                    What skills and personality traits do you think are important for nurses to possess?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Patience, attention to details, and the willingness to learn make a great nurse
                        </p>
                     <h3>Could you describe the difficult situation that you encounter as a nurse and what you've learned from it?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Covid has taught me a lot about how to be patient, compassionate, and to really
                         put your patients before my own safety. I think being a nurse is a noble profession. 
                         Not a lot of people can say that their jobs are noble jobs and they are proud to be 
                         in their profession the same way I feel towards nursing. 
                        </p>
                     <h3>Why do you want to work in the ICU as a nurse?</h3>
                        <p>I am meticulous. I enjoy learning the details. ICU patients are sick. Most of them are 
                        in multiorgan failure. They need a holistic approach to effectively and safely care for them. 
                        </p>
                     <h3>What are the challenges you have to face?</h3>
                        <p>Being in the critical care setting is extremely rewarding. It is especially true if you 
                        want to make a big impact on someone's life when their lives are hanging by a thread. 
                        It could be extremely stressful. I know a few ICU nurses who were so burned out that they
                         decided to choose another unit or quit nursing altogether after covid. 
                        </p>
                     <h3>Do you have any goals and how do you work to achieve them?</h3>
                        <p>My goal is to continue to deliver excellent care to my patients 
                        and to touch each of their lives with compassionate support.
